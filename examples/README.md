# Examples

Each subdirectory is a self-contained example that produces a PDF.

## Running

```bash
go run ./examples/hello
```

## Structure

```
examples/
├── hello/          # minimal one-page PDF
└── README.md
```

## Adding an example

1. Create a new directory under `examples/` (e.g., `examples/invoice/`).
2. Add a single `main.go` that produces one PDF.
3. Include any required data files in the same directory (XML, images, etc.).
4. Keep it self-contained — no shared code between examples.
5. Add a doc comment at the top of `main.go` describing what the example does and how to run it.
6. Add the directory to the structure list above.
